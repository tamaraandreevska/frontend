# Working with git - Using Github Desktop ‚öôÔ∏è

### What is Github Desktop? 
Github Desktop, is a desktop application that allows you to work with git technologies more easily, 
without the complexity of remembering all the git commands like git clone, git commit, git push and so on. So basically, it provides you with an easy to use UI, and it offers a great user experiance. Firther in this document you can find out how to make easier your work on the projects.

### Step by step, to successfull commit and push!
The first thing that you need to do after insalling Github desktop on your machnie is clone any existing repository from Gtihub or any other platform that uses git (Gitlab, BitBucket etc.). In our case we are talking about Github platform. So the first thing is the clone command that will clone the repository created remotely on Github, to your local machine (file system). But instead of remembering the clone command, how to use it, or how to use any other command, here is the Github desktop nice and easy UI! 

1. Simply start the GitHub app on your machine and you will see the following screen:

2. Then the following screen appears

3. After all of this you wait for a few seconds and the next screen appears which is basically the repository cloned on your machine. You can notice on the image below that you can switch between several repositories, check on which branch you are working currently (it's only master for us now) or you can fetch(pull) if there are changes on the origin repository on github. Check the print screen :)

8. After that you start to add HTML/CSS files, or maybe JS files, you implement your feature logic and so on. After saving the work, you go back to GitHub Desktop app, and it immediately recognizes your change. Check the image.

9. When you have implemented enough to commit, the next thing is committing your changes and then push them also to the origin repo (the repo on GitHub). Check how you do that.

10. The last step that remains is the push command, so that all the commits can go to the origin repository on github.
In order to find out how to push the changes, check the image below.

### The end üòé
Well the previous 10 steps will help you setup a github repository locally to your machine and also working with it. It will help you to put the code from your homeworks there and instead of sending zips, sending just a link to the appropriate folder of the exercise. Take in mind that the repository must be public so that I can see whats there.

Another usefull thing that these steps will offer you is that, the repository with the code that we type on the class as demo code, you can just clone it to your machine, and after every my commit, to use the Pull/Fetch command and just like that you will have the lastly typed code in front of you (no more downloading zips) üòÅ
